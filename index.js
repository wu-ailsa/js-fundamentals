/* What you must do:

Your goal is to analyze and transform this data such that the output of your program is an array of objects each containing the following information, in the following format:
{
    // the ID of the learner for which this data has been collected
    "id": number,
    // the learnerâ€™s total, weighted average, in which assignments
    // with more points_possible should be counted for more
    // e.g. a learner with 50/100 on one assignment and 190/200 on another
    // would have a weighted average score of 240/300 = 80%.
    "avg": number,
    // each assignment should have a key with its ID,
    // and the value associated with it should be the percentage that
    // the learner scored on the assignment (submission.score / points_possible)
    <assignment_id>: number,
    // if an assignment is not yet due, it should not be included in either
    // the average or the keyed dictionary of scores
}
