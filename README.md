# SBA 308: JavaScript Fundamentals

## Objectives
- Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
- Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
- Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
- Develop functions to create reusable code.
- Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
- Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.


## Instructions
You will create a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as described by a specification. This is a very typical situation in industry, and this particular scenario has been modified from a real application.
### Objects 
   - CourseInfo 
   - AssignmentGroup
   - AssignmentInfo
   - LearnerSubmission
### Functions
   - getLearnerData(CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, [LearnerSubmission])


## Requirements
- Declare variables properly using let and const where appropriate.
- Use operators to perform calculations on variables and literals.
- Use strings, numbers, and Boolean values cached within variables.
- Use at least two if/else statements to control program flow. Optionally, use at least one switch statement.
- Use try/catch statements to manage potential errors in the code, such as incorrectly formatted or typed data being fed into your program.
- Utilize at least two different types of loops.
- Utilize at least one loop control keyword such as break or continue.
- Create and/or manipulate arrays and objects.
- Demonstrate the retrieval, manipulation, and removal of items in an array or properties in an object.
- Use functions to handle repeated tasks.
- Program outputs processed data as described above. Partial credit will be earned depending on the level of adherence to the described behavior.
- Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
- Commit frequently to the git repository.
- Include a README file that contains a description of your application.
